# Radial network visualisation for Farming the Future, a UK body of organizations involved in food security.

[Explore the network](https://rowlandwilliams.github.io/farmingthefuture/)

Organizations within the network bid together for funding from a central governmental body. 
This tool can be used by an organization to identify similar partner organizations (in terms of links, such as location and size) within the network with which they could work with in the future.  

Stack: D3.js

Notes from the build process: 
  - Mouseover interactivity can be a little slow. This visualisation is complex with over 1500 links. In future iterations, I would consider using html canvas, as some suggest it may allow quicker rendering.
